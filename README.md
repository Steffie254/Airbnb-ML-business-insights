# Airbnb Business Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Airbnb listings data** to uncover key business insights and opportunities for growth.  
Using Python and data science techniques, I explored trends in pricing, availability, customer preferences, and location-based patterns.  
The goal is to provide **actionable recommendations** that can help hosts, property managers, and businesses optimize their Airbnb strategies.  

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Airbnb dataset (Airbnb.csv)  
- **Size:** ~X rows, Y columns *(replace with actual numbers)*  
- **Features include:**  
  - `Listing ID`  
  - `Name`  
  - `Neighborhood`  
  - `Room Type`  
  - `Price`  
  - `Minimum Nights`  
  - `Availability`  
  - `Number of Reviews`  
  - `Review Scores`

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploration  
- **Low-code ML** tools for additional insights  
- **PDF Report** generated with reportlab  

## 📊 Key Insights
Some highlights from the analysis include:
- Neighborhoods with the **highest average prices** vs. most affordable stays  
- Correlation between **room type** and **average rating/occupancy**  
- Optimal **pricing ranges** for maximizing bookings  
- Seasonal/availability trends affecting profitability  
- **Revenue optimization opportunities** for hosts  

## 📑 Deliverables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and descriptive stats  
- **Business Insights Report:** [Airbnb_Business_Insights.pdf](./Airbnb_Business_Insights.pdf)  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** [Low_code_ML_additional_Project.ipynb](./Low_code_ML_additional_Project.ipynb)
